This implementation is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

In order to run the tests: 
```bash
yarn jest
```

## Brief Project Structure 
```
[] for folders

[shop-apotheke]
|
â”œâ”€â”€ [components]
â”‚     Reusable react components. They ought to be broken into subfolders for more clarity if need be. 
|
â”œâ”€â”€ [utils] with tests
â”‚  â”‚ __ date    ===> all functions related to time manipulation.
â”‚  â”‚ __ mappers ===> should contain any function that maps fetched JSON data to typed data to be outputed through hooks.
â”‚  â”‚   
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ ... .tests.ts
â”‚       every util needs to be tested just to make sure their behavior doesn't change during continuous development.
|
â”œâ”€â”€ [pages]
|     nextJS considers every file here to be corresponding to a page unless it starts with _
|
â”œâ”€â”€ types
|     contains the global type definitions to be exported and reused across the project, 
|     it can be structured differently.
| 
â”œâ”€â”€ [assets]
|  â”‚ __ labels  ===> all string constants used in the output.
|  â”‚ __ links   ===> all static urls or links to be used as well.
|
â”œâ”€â”€ [hooks]
|  â”‚ __ useFetch  ===> responsible for fetching the necessary data and map it to the expected types. 
|  | __ useStarringRepos ===> responsible for setting and retrieving the locally stored starring
